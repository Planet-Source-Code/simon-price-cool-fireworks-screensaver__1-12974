<h4 align="left">About</h4>
<p align="left">This is a small program I have made in VB, and it's intended use
is as a screensaver. It uses DirectX 7 although it also works on DirectX 8 (I've
tested it on DX8) and really shows the power of DirectX. It features a display
of 20 simultaneous fireworks, all whooshing, exploding, then blending and
blurring into the night sky! It runs very smooth on my PC, if you find it runs a
bit slow then you can change the first line of code, change the constant
NUM_FIREWORKS to a lower number and the program will run faster (although with
less fireworks).</p>
<h4 align="left">Requirements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">DirectX 7.0 or higher installed</font></li>

</ul>
<h4 align="left">Feedback</h4>
<p align="left">I'd appreciate it if you reward my efforts by either voting for
me on <a href="http://www.planet-source-code.com">www.planet-source-code.com/vb</a>
, left me feedback there or email me at <a href="mailto:si@VBgames.co.uk">Si@VBgames.co.uk</a>
, or visited my website at <a href="http://www.VBgames.co.uk">www.VBgames.co.uk</a>
. I'll consider all suggestion you make to improve the program, although I do
already have an idea of how to make this more interesting.</p>
<h4 align="left">Copywrite</h4>
<p align="left">I spent a lot of time on this (actually, that's a lie, it only
took a few hours, but I did work hard in that time!), and I have given you some
cool source code for free. If you rip me off by stealing my source code to claim
as your own, then I'll do my best to make you ashamed of that. If you would like
to put this code on your website, then please email me first, I'll have no
reason to say no.</p>
